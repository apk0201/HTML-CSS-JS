    ><p>Bharatanatyam, also previously called Sadhir Attam, is a major form of Indian classical dance that originated in Tamil Nadu.
    Bharatanatyam is one of the oldest classical dance traditions in India. 
    It has been nurtured in the temples and courts of southern India since the ancient era.
    It expresses South Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism.
    <br>
    Description of Bharatanatyam by 2nd century CE is noted in the ancient Tamil epic Silappatikaram, while temple sculptures of 6th to 9th century CE suggest it was a well refined performance art by the mid-1st millennium CE.
    Bharatanatyam is the oldest classical dance tradition in India.
    The dance form was prevalent in ancient Tamil Nadu, and several books have coded them such as Natya Shastra.
    Natya Shastra is just a codification by an unknown author of the forms of dance existing in Tamil Nadu.

    ><p>Kathak is one of the eight major forms of Indian classical dance.
        The origin of Kathak is traditionally attributed to the traveling bards of ancient northern India known as Kathakars or storytellers.
        The term Kathak is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word Katha which means "story", and Kathakar which means "the one who tells a story", or "to do with stories".
        Wandering Kathakars communicated stories from the great epics and ancient mythology through dance, songs and music.
        Kathak dancers tell various stories through their hand movements and extensive footwork, their body movements and flexibility but most importantly through their facial expressions. 
        Kathak evolved during the Bhakti movement, particularly by incorporating the childhood and stories of the Hindu god Krishna, as well as independently in the courts of north Indian kingdoms.
        Kathak is unique in having both Hindu and Muslim gharanas and cultural elements.
        Kathak performances include Urdu Ghazals and commonly use instruments brought during Mughal period.

    ><p>Kuchipudi is one of the eight major Indian classical dances.
        It originated in a village named Kuchipudi in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.
        Kuchipudi is a dance-drama performance, with its roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra.
        It developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major classical dances of India.
        Evidence of Kuchipudi's existence in an older version are found in copper inscriptions of the 10th century, and by the 15th century in texts such as the Machupalli Kaifat.
        Kuchipudi tradition holds that Tirtha Narayana Yati – a sanyassin of Advaita Vedanta persuasion,and his disciple, an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi, founded and systematized the modern version of Kuchipudi in the 17th century.
        Kuchipudi largely developed as a Hindu god Krishna-oriented Vaishnavism tradition, and it is most closely related to Bhagavata Mela.

        One-act plays of Sattriya are called Ankiya Nat, which combine the aesthetic and the religious through a ballad, dance and drama.The plays are usually performed in the dance community halls of monastery temples (sattras).
        The themes played are related to Lord Krishna, sometimes other Vishnu avatars such as Rama and Sita and stories from epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana are also referred to. 
        It is to be mentioned that the philosophic religion of Mahapurush Srimanta Sankaradeva was on the basis of the Vedanta, Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavad Puran, so there is no presence of Radha in Sattriya dance presentations.
